## Project Euler Problem 150 (Midterm)
### Goal: to implement an efficient solution to problem 150 of the Project Euler series (https://projecteuler.net/problem=150)

### Files
1. ProjectEuler_prob150.asm: 
This is the file with all the 4 test cases (2 small cases and 2 slightly big cases)

2) euler150_test.asm: 
This file carries the monster array. Including it as an array in the main.asm file would make the test active. The reason why we have it in a separate file is that it makes the assembling process much faster without the big array.
